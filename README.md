# LAMP GUI
A GUI For LAMP Servers.

The project came to mind when reading a thread in a [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/131122390879338/permalink/310197436305165/) when someone was turned off by the LAMP setup not having a GUI interface. Though I do feel having a CLI server is best, I think it is a concern that people will avoid Linux simply because it doesn't have a GUI for the tools they need to use. Especially if they can get a GUI for the software they are using elseware.
